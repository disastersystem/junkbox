* This will focus the teqnicues that is available online when learning.

* Use both your and opponent moves in showing pressure on squares?

* You lose the diogonal view, making it harder to visualize the bishop play.

* Is there any difference between two colours, check theory and test.

* Colored squares allow you to easily see that none of you pieces can is capturable.

* Is it only the capture pressure we're after there? As a pawn can move to a square without creating any pressure, but rather it creates
pressure on the two squares to the side of where it moved.

* Visualize the concepts of:
	* forks, pins etc.
	* unprotected pieces

* What does the existing odd/even pattern mean, how do the pros utalize it?
	* Dark square bishop, light square bishop. 
	If your opponent has a dark square bishop and you're low on time make sure to not place any pieces on dark squares
	to easily prevent pins.

* If there is a learning effect, will this stick after going back to the regular odd/even pattern?

* You mostly think about what you can do, not what your opponent is doing.

* Theory
	* Related to colour and learning.
	* Related to pattern recogniztion. Humans learn by pattern (see gamestorming), this also related to interaction design.

* Problems
	* Squares merge together visually if the have the same amount of pressure. Spacing or border needed.
