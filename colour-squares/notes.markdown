* Use both your and opponent moves in showing pressure on squares?

* Colored squares allow you to easily see that none of you pieces can is capturable.

* Is it only the capture pressure we're after there? As a pawn can move to a square without creating any pressure, but rather it creates
pressure on the two squares to the side of where it moved.

* What does the existing odd/even pattern mean, how do the pros utalize it?
	* Dark square bishop, light square bishop. 
	If your opponent has a dark square bishop and you're low on time make sure to not place any pieces on dark squares
	to easily prevent pins.

* If there is a learning effect, will this stick after going back to the regular odd/even pattern?

* Theory
	* Related to colour and learning.
	* Related to pattern recogniztion. Humans learn by pattern (see gamestorming), this also related to interaction design.

* Problems
	* Squares merge together visually if the have the same amount of pressure. Spacing or border needed.
